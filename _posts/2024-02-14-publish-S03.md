## Abstract

Although early life colonization of commensal microbes contributes to long-lasting immune imprinting in host tissues, little is known regarding the pathophysiological consequences of postnatal microbial tuning of cutaneous immunity. Here, we show that postnatal exposure to specific skin commensal Staphylococcus lentus (S. lentus) promotes the extent of atopic dermatitis (AD)-like inflammation in adults through priming of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Early postnatal skin is dynamically populated by discrete subset of primed ILC2s driven by microbiota-dependent induction of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in keratinocytes. Specifically, the indole-3-aldehyde-producing tryptophan metabolic pathway, shared across Staphylococcus species, is involved in TSLP-mediated ILC2 priming. Furthermore, we demonstrate a critical contribution of the early postnatal S. lentus-TSLP-ILC2 priming axis in facilitating AD-like inflammation that is not replicated by later microbial exposure. Thus, our findings highlight the fundamental role of time-dependent neonatal microbial-skin crosstalk in shaping the threshold of innate type 2 immunity co-opted in adulthood.
